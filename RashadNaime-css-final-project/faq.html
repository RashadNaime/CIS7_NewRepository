                <p>Here you'll find some frequently asked questions about our hotel.
                    We hope that you find it interesting and informative. These are the questions
                    that people call our front desk with most often.</p>

            <article id="primary">
                <p class="question">How did we get started, and whats the theme?</p>
                <p class="answer">Hotel Zelda is based off the popular franchise by Nintendo "The Legend of Zelda".
                    Our hotel theme is based off of the design of hyrule castle, the main castle in which princess Zelda lives,
                    as well as other main locations and themes from the legend of zelda universe. We started up in 2015 after the release of another new Legend of Zelda game.
                </p>
                <p class="question">What are the check-in and check-out times?</p>
                <p class="answer">Check-out time is 11am and check-in is between 1 and 5pm. Speak to the front desk staff if you have special circumstances.</p>
                <p class="question">In addition to your accommodations, what other services do you offer?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Whatever Hotel is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, a fully
                    catered business meeting, or an event as special as a wedding. We do offer great room
                    service food as well as a full service spa, both of which help our guests feel like they've
                    come to the right place to get away from it all. </p>
                <p class="question">Do you have a pool?</p>
                <p class="answer">Like all hotels we too have a pool, but ours is actually quite unique. You'll just have to see it to believe it.</p>
                <p class="question">Do you accept AAA discounts, or other discount cards?</p>
                <p class="answer">No we don't accept any discount cards, but that doesn't mean
                    we don't have discount prices on our rooms. We do offer different kinds
                    of specials, some seasonal, some for senior, just for returning guests, etc. Visit
                    the events page on this Web site to see if any special discounts are currently
                    in effect, or just call our reservations desk.</p>
